I am an experienced audit and risk management expert with more than ten years of experience in the public and financial services industries. 

I work as a Senior Auditor for Indonesia's Financial Services Authority (OJK). I coordinate and oversee the implementation of the institution's internal anti-fraud policy, which includes managing the whistle-blowing mechanism and conducting investigation audits. I have a strong set of certificates, such as Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE), Certified Public Accountant (CPA), and Certified Integrity Officer.

I am currently working on my Master of Business Analytics at Monash University to improve my skills in making decisions based on data. By learning how to use modern analytical tools, I will be able to not only find financial problems, but also use advanced analytical methods to deal with the problems of fraud detection and financial regulation in a fast-paced, changing world.
